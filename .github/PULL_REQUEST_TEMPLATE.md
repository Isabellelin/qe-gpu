Thank you for creating a pull request to contribute to QE-GPU code! Before you open the request please review the following guidelines and tips to help it be more easily integrated:
* Describe the scope of your change -- i.e. what the change does and what parts of the code were modified. This will help us understand any risks of integrating the code.
* Describe any known limitations with your change. For example if the change doesn't apply to a supported platform of the library please mention it.
* Please run any tests or examples that can exercise your modified code. We strive to not break users of the code and running tests/examples helps with this process.

Thank you again for contributing! Testing and integration of any change will occur as soon as possible, but be aware it is impossible to immediately respond to every request. There is no need to bump or check in on a pull request (it will clutter the discussion of the request).

After reviewing the guidelines above you can delete this text from the pull request and proceed further
